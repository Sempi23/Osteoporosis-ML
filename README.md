# Osteoporosis Risk Prediction - Optimizing Machine Learning Models for Early Diagnosis

## Overview
This project leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to enhance the accuracy and reliability of osteoporosis risk prediction, enabling proactive healthcare strategies and improved patient outcomes.

## Problem Statement
Osteoporosis often goes undiagnosed until its advanced stages, leading to significant health complications and increased healthcare costs. Early detection is crucial for effective intervention and prevention. This project addresses this issue by using machine learning to improve the accuracy and reliability of osteoporosis risk prediction.

## Project Objectives
- Develop a robust predictive algorithm to identify individuals at high risk for osteoporosis.
- Facilitate early diagnosis and preventive care.
- Enhance current screening processes.
- Contribute to better patient management and reduced healthcare burden.
